This blog is part of a series that I am writing to document my journey of creating a portfolio website from scratch. If you haven‚Äôt read the previous blog I highly recommend you to go and check it out. It walks you through the whole process of [How I managed to convince myself to create a portfolio website](/blog/building_portfolio_1).

## üì∑¬†Looking at the bigger picture

Now coming back to the task at hand. In my opinion choosing a design for my website was the most difficult part of the process. I say that because finalising a design meant that I had a clear idea about what I wanted to showcase in that website. Now, to first understand what the content of my website was going to look like I had to lay out a high-level structure of the website to know what design decisions should I make. In my head this unfolded as follows:

- The site should have all my socials and a solid channel for communication (I went with E-Mail) in case a potential collaborator comes along. (wow so optimistic üòõ)
- It should also contain links to projects that I have done in the past _(for bragging rights ofc)_
- And, I should be able to share my un-censored thoughts on this platform (you might see more blogs regarding this since this is an ongoing process)

With these things in mind, I now had a vague idea of what kind of content I‚Äôll be dealing with. I had certain keywords in my mind like socials, project showcase, a thought archive etc. and they each sort of branched out into ideas of their own.

## üí°Choosing a design ideology

Now that I had a bit of an idea about the type of content I am dealing with, I thought going on a creative showcase website like [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/), [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) etc. would solve my problem. But guess what, heall naww. I was greeted with such insane spectrum of designs that choosing one for inspiration seemed **damn near impossible**. So, I went on ahead on my web surfing journey to look for recent design trends, and ALAS! I went where all men have gone before to seek inspiration, the [Apple website](https://www.apple.com/). At that time, when I visited their site, they used a design ideology called the [Bento Grid](https://medium.com/@hanekcud/bento-grids-what-are-they-and-how-to-use-them-in-your-ui-design-bc55b20f7b74). I can write about it for days but TLDR; it looks like neat little boxes stacked on top of each other to create a grid. The design ideology resonated with me since it looked minimalist, tidy and the overall look was really boxy and organised, which was right up my alley.

## üó∫Ô∏è¬†Creating a blueprint

With all the tools needed to create a blueprint for my website I opened up [Figma](https://www.figma.com) and started creating a basic layout which I can then use to reference when I am developing the website. Once again let‚Äôs dive into what went inside my head when I was creating the mockup.

- ‚ÄúHmmm‚Ä¶I need to have a nav bar for sure, we can go with a pretty standard navbar with logo on the left and page navigation on the right.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúI would need an intro section which has some text describing what I do and what I stand for professionally and maybe, we can have some socials in that section as well‚Äù (Its always better to have a [CTA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-call-to-action-cta-design/) right in front of the users face. **BAM!** CTA)
- ‚ÄúUghh‚Ä¶I need to show my face‚Äù (I really didn‚Äôt want to because I am an extremely camera averse person)
- ‚ÄúI think each box in the bento grid could make up a showcase tile for a project, I could have a screen shot for preview that would fill the tile up and make each tile unique which when the users clicks takes them to the deployed application.‚Äù (In hindsight this might not be the best decision but well‚Ä¶I can iterate on that so I went ahead with it)
- ‚ÄúAlso, I should have a footer which _explicitly_ tells people who are on this site to collaborate with me on how to reach out to me.‚Äù

After jotting these things down and basing my design decisions on them, I finally ended up with this. Not too shabby right? RIGHT?. But I still wanted to integrate a blog in my portfolio because that was one of the core features that drove me to pursue this project. But I told myself, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves and work as an iterator rather than a perfectionist.‚Äù (Yes, I actually said that to myself, I‚Äôm weird)

Spoiler Alert: I did integrate a blog ü§ì

## üèÅ¬†Finishing up the design and next steps

With a basic mockup in my hand I now had a clear idea on how the website should look like. As I mentioned before I really wanted to add a blog section to my portfolio, and I am working on it, so stay tuned for an update on that. Meanwhile, coming back to the present timeline, I chose to move forward with the design at hand. In the next blog, we‚Äôll go over the details of my thought process while [developing the actual site](https://www.notion.so/Developing-the-actual-site-90e657d4744849578040a444647b5d85?pvs=21). Until then stay motivated, stay curious and keep building! ‚ù§Ô∏è
