In this series of blog posts I would walk you through my learning journey as I create my online portfolio for the first time. From getting the motivation behind it, to setting up the project and learning how to optimise the hell out of it, we‚Äôll leave no leaf unturned üçÄ. So like any other reasonable human being let‚Äôs understand why I _actually_ went through with this project and not just watch a 2hr video on YouTube by a person building his portfolio from scratch.

## üñºÔ∏è¬†Background

So just to give you a background, I am a software developer based in India who graduated from college in 2021 with a CSE degree. In no way, shape, or form was I an ideal student, if anything I was actually the opposite. Anyway, long story short, I have been in tech for almost 3 yrs now _(this might change depending on when you read this)_ and have worked at 2 different companies. The first one was a consulting firm where I worked as a Business Data Analyst. In a nutshell, I had to manage part of a Big Data pipeline, rewrite complex SQL queries in PySpark while acting as a full-stack developer, since in 2021 we saw attrition rates go BRRRRR and all of our senior devs had left except one. The other one is a web3 company for which I currently develop Dapps for, and help with their overall online presence.

## üî´¬†The Trigger

On a random Saturday, I was scrolling through YouTube on my phone and I came across one of those videos in which a person reviews portfolio websites submitted by their subscribers or patrons. Of course, I clicked on it and started watching it, but‚Ä¶midway through this video a weird feeling hit me. I was enjoying watching these amazing websites made by other people, something was missing. It felt like the joy I was feeling was part of something greater, sort of like a pool of joy, which was made up by everyone who dedicated their precious time into creating something that people around the world can experience. Soon I realised that the reason I felt _weird_ was because I don‚Äôt have any contributions to this pool of joy, I am just taking my cup and drinking out of it to my hearts content.

## üó£Ô∏è¬†Pep Talk

Now, I knew that something needed to be done to address this feeling. And like the lazy human I am I was still not convinced that I actually needed to do something about it, so I started looking around. I started by opening LinkedIn, terrible place, I know, but what I did was I started sifting through people‚Äôs profiles and realised that most of the people who I looked up to in my field, or batchmates who were actively building stuff in college, had some sort of a website, showcasing their previous work or just a dev blog to keep their thoughts organised. Most of them were not flashy and riddled with 3D animations like I saw in the YouTube video, but each website was a place for the author to showcase their work and thoughts. In that moment I realised a few things:

- A portfolio website is like a developers self portrait
- These portfolios are not made to be submitted to [awwwards.com](http://awwwards.com) (generally)
- The content in them is targeted towards a specific group of people with specific interests
- Each site is unique which distinguishes them, but all of them have this sense of giving back to the community
- And, building something from scratch is a great learning opportunity but documenting that process it in the very thing that you built is extremely empowering.

## ü§©¬†All pepped up

After hours of sifting through websites and having multiple epiphanies inside my head I was now ready to take on this challenge of building a portfolio of my own and showcase my self portrait to the world. In the next part of this series I‚Äôll walk you through the whole process of [choosing a design for my website](/blog/building_portfolio_2) and my thought process while selecting from the bajillion options that the internet gives us. Till then stay motivated, stay curious and keep building! ‚ù§Ô∏è
