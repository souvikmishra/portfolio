Each day I confront myself
of the sins I committed yesterday,
only to walk on the same path again.
I seek salvation, yet I write these words
intoxicated out of my mind.
These tunes of RnB mimic your presence,
But you were never there, were you?
Maybe they just mimic the longing that I had.
Each time I hear the artist utter the word 'you',
I imaging your silhouette in my mind.
Guess I am not fine by myself.
So with each track that plays,
I let my imagination run wild,
hoping to unite my purpose with my passion, you.
