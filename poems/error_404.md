I thought only bruises hurt.
Never experienced a pain
so immense and not see myself bleed.
The wounds were deep,
but no scars were found.

The bearer was the culprit,
the one who inflicted,
but no weapon was found.

Still I'll wake up tomorrow.
Hoping to heal myself.
My remedy caused this,
but no cure was found.
