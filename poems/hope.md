Stuck inside a maze.
Searching for a hand,
yet again.
Solving a puzzle
with my own soul
on the line.

For I have sinned,
a lot. Still...
I seek redemption
within you.
As he doesn't
believe in me,
neither do I in him.

See through an artist's eye,
a masterpiece.
Showcasing its magnificence
to the world.
