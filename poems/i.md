I love taking a walk.
For as long as I can remember,
I have been walking,
or at least trying to walk.
I am walking right now.

I am thinking;
I have stopped here,
sometimes there too.
I have stopped at many places,
in some places for a
longer duration, in some, shorter.

There are people with me, walking.
Some, who I encountered
when I started walking,
some, quite recently.
We are all walking;
chatting, in between.

The walk, stripped of any rationale,
is quite enjoyable if I'm honest.
I slow my pace down to
fully embrace each step.
I'll take a walk again tomorrow,
I guess.
