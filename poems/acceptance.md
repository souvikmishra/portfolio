Life passes by.
The more I live,
the faster it slips away.
Distant past seems
as if moments ago.

Today, I stopped,
halted my pace.
as if trying to grasp that moment.
Clench it in my fist,
hoping I can live it a bit longer.

Hoping to make up for all the other
moments I couldn't grab.
Through all my might,
it escaped, left for eternity,
Leaving in me
a want to live it more.

Every page I turned, burned,
so I sat down,
took out another one,
just so I can turn it again.
Sounds of merry and sorrow,
echo at the end of a dark alley.
I'm in the middle.
