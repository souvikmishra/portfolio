Keen as a kindergartener,
her presence intrigued me.
Lost in tranquility,
I search for the place
I was destined to earn.

Amused by nature,
and it's children,
She harmonized with the warmth
and comfort it offered.

Intense,
My life, a poem.
The shrewd poet
wrote the most
beautiful verse
with my tears.
