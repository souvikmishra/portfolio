It's cold outside, foggy too.
I see an empty road in front of me.
Not a single soul in sight,
no sound to be heard.
I don't remember coming here.

The mist stares at me through
its thick veil of fluff.
The tension around me
is weirdly comforting.
I don't feel alone anymore.

Each movement, each breath I take,
brings the mist, a tad bit closer.
It's getting dark, the sun as almost set.
I make haste as if there is
some place I am to be.

The fog gets thicker and thicker.
I forsee the inevitablity of events.
Nevertheless I struggle with all my might.
It engulfs me in its embrace.
I see a man in the distance, making haste.
