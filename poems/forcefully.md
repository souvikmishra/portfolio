Painful to accept
how inconsiderate I was
to myself.
Finding solace in
vessels filled with
emptiness.

Once an immovable object,
melting at your softest touch.
Whole heartedly,
I welcomed devastation.

Love was the answer, indeed.
Found at the end of a stick,
which burned with agony.
Tore a piece of myself with
every drag I inhaled.
