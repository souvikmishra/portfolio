Shards of reflection,
Ipierce through my lids,
to live once again.
Snatiching my soul as you
took my pride from me.

The weather induced a
shiver, you a halt.
Comforting the restless in me.
Leaving collaterals as
pieces of myself.

Darkness prevailed,
a rebirth saw its forthcoming.
'Tis the season of winter,
and 'tis the season of yule.
I'm the mirror.
