A kiss of death was
all I wished for.
Didn't know I would
cherish demise so much.
For almost everything halted,
except,
the riptides underneath,
as I held your serene
scenic beauty in my arms.
A poor mans gift.
Something was missing.
I didn't know what it was.
Something fixed that.
I don't know what.
I was enjoying.
