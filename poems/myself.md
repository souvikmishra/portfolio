Who was I kidding?
Embracing the loop around me.
Highs and lows, the path I chose.
Fought with fire, still it froze.

The birth of this,
merry as it should be,
brought serenity.
How could one predict
the sorrow, inevitable.

Clouded thoughts rained
like the monsoon.
Barricading the warmth and luminiscence
as one shivered
in silence.
