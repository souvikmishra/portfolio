A nostalgic feeling shivers
down my spine, remingding me of times
when life dind't feel tough.
Seasons of merry an warmth
conincide with palpable happiness.

The sun shines a tad brighter, it knows.
Confined, I couldn't withness it.
Living life in binaries, you, a sine.
A devilish soul asks for redemption.

An experience, a weird feeling of comfort.
A new page with hints from the past.
Sloppy penmanship couldn't ruin the lore.
The writer lives the tale he writes.
