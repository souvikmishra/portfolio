Sifting through pages of past,
I realised the feeble
nature of promises.
Once a token of care, love...
now resides in a dark corner.
Hoping, to see light again.

Seperated by fate,
divided by trauma.
Unseen ties were severed.
A winter night during summer.
Rain poured through windows of reality.
It was dry outside.

Overwhelmed by obession, isolated.
Murdered by words,
forgivable by law.
Yearning for a sign,
I look at the heavens,
unconsciously.
Make a wish.
