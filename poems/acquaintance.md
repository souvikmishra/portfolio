I met a stranger today.
Distracted with responsibilities and worries,
indulged in a storm of thoughts,
I felt a hand on my shoulder.
Exchanging pleasantries as we walked.

Conversations flew,
surrounded by a monotonous ether.
The calm was soothing, yet,
the silence wasn't.
The air filled a void
with vices long lost,
birthed by empty words.

A nostalgic stride,
on a bitter sweet road.
I see them off,
parting ways in a sense familiar.
Aware, I repress,
to meet an aquaintance.
