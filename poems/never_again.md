As I searched for
the light to guide
me through the darkness, I was
struck by utter awe
and despair to see
her give birth to it.
I mourned the death
of the essence of
life that I withheld
in my emotions.
Conservative and cautious
about who I let in.
A funeral of black
and white. Sorrow was
where the grave was dug.
